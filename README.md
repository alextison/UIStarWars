## General Information
- The goal of this project was to reproduce a User Interface from a [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/proto/xaisLkNZJvZXq6Ca8qO6El/UI_StarWars?node-id=172%3A291&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=172%3A243) as fast as possible
- This UI had been provided in a [Benjamin Code's video](https://youtu.be/Ld97MuYMaQQ) in early 2022
- I undertook this project because the challenge particularly tempted me and I wanted to improve my integration skills


## Technologies Used
